# Topical: the Frontend

I worked with a remote team of colleagues to develop a shopping assistant application as a Progressive Web App (PWA). Users can easily scan products in the store via the barcode or search by name to identify common irritants in topical products. Topical uses a RESTful API built with Django and the front end is built with React and styled using Material-UI. This app is for mobile use.
